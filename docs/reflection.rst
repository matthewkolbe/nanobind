C++26 Static Reflection
========================

nanobind supports automatic binding generation using C++26 static reflection
(P2996). Instead of manually writing ``.def()`` calls for every member, you can
reflect entire types and namespaces in a single line.

Requirements
------------

A C++ compiler with `P2996 <https://wg21.link/p2996>`_ static reflection
support. Known compatible compilers include:

- **GCC 16+** with ``-std=c++26 -freflection``
- **Bloomberg clang-p2996** fork

The header is guarded by ``__cpp_reflection`` / ``__cpp_impl_reflection`` and
compiles to nothing on compilers without reflection support, so it is safe to
include unconditionally.

Basic usage
-----------

Include ``nanobind/nb_reflect.h`` and use ``nb::reflect_``:

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include <nanobind/nb_reflect.h>

   namespace nb = nanobind;

   struct Point {
       double x, y, z;

       Point() : x(0), y(0), z(0) {}
       Point(double x, double y, double z) : x(x), y(y), z(z) {}

       double length() const;
       void scale(double factor);
       static Point origin() { return {0, 0, 0}; }
   };

   enum class Color { Red, Green, Blue };

   NB_MODULE(my_module, m) {
       nb::reflect_<^^Color, ^^Point>(m);
   }

This single call is equivalent to:

.. code-block:: cpp

   nb::enum_<Color>(m, "Color")
       .value("Red", Color::Red)
       .value("Green", Color::Green)
       .value("Blue", Color::Blue);

   nb::class_<Point>(m, "Point")
       .def(nb::init<>())
       .def(nb::init<double, double, double>())
       .def_rw("x", &Point::x)
       .def_rw("y", &Point::y)
       .def_rw("z", &Point::z)
       .def("length", &Point::length)
       .def("scale", &Point::scale)
       .def_static("origin", &Point::origin);

What gets bound
---------------

For **classes**, ``reflect_`` automatically binds:

- All public non-copy/move constructors (including default and parameterized)
- All public nonstatic data members (as read-write properties)
- All public static data members (read-only if ``const``, read-write otherwise)
- All public nonstatic methods (including overloads)
- All public static methods

For **enums**, all enumerators are bound by name.

Names are derived from the C++ identifiers automatically -- no strings needed.

Namespace reflection
--------------------

You can reflect an entire namespace at once. All classes, enums, and free
functions within it are bound:

.. code-block:: cpp

   namespace game {
       struct Enemy { std::string type; int hp; };
       struct Weapon { std::string name; int damage; };
       enum class Rarity { Common, Rare, Legendary };
       double damage_per_second(double damage, double speed);
   }

   NB_MODULE(my_module, m) {
       nb::reflect_<^^game>(m);
   }

Mixing types and namespaces
---------------------------

``reflect_`` accepts any mix of reflected types, enums, namespaces, and free
functions:

.. code-block:: cpp

   nb::reflect_<^^Color, ^^Point, ^^Player, ^^game, ^^some_free_function>(m);

Overloaded functions
--------------------

Overloaded methods and free functions are handled automatically. Each overload
is registered as a separate binding, and nanobind's dispatch resolves them at
call time based on argument types:

.. code-block:: cpp

   struct Point {
       double distance(const Point& other) const;
       double distance(double x, double y, double z) const;
   };

.. code-block:: python

   p1 = my_module.Point(1, 2, 3)
   p2 = my_module.Point(4, 5, 6)
   p1.distance(p2)           # calls Point::distance(const Point&)
   p1.distance(4.0, 5.0, 6.0)  # calls Point::distance(double, double, double)

Limitations
-----------

- Requires a compiler with P2996 support. As of March 2026, mainline Clang
  and MSVC do not implement the proposal.
- Private and protected members are skipped.
- Operator overloads (``operator+``, etc.) are not yet mapped to Python
  dunder methods (as of March 2026).
- Virtual functions and inheritance hierarchies are not yet handled
  specially (as of March 2026).
